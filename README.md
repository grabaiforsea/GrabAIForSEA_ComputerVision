# [Grab] AI For SEA - Computer Vision Challenge

## Introduction

This is a submission to Computer Vision challenge of ***AI For SEA*** competition organised by Grab.
Given the Stanford Cars dataset [1], the goal is to recognise model and make from images of cars.

The proposed approaches are based on deep learning for image recognition, 
including transfer learning with ResNet50 and Bilinear Convolutional Neural Network (BiCNN). 

## Environment

This project was implemented using Python 3.7.1 and Keras API in TensorFlow 1.13.1
running on 8GB of RAM and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M.

Before running the codes, please install the required packages to your Python environment
by running the following command in terminal:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Approaches

### Transfer Learning with ResNet50



### Bilinear Convolutional Neural Network (BiCNN)
